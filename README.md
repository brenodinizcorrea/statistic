# Statistics — A Problem-Driven Approach

This repository is a structured study of Statistics organized around clearly defined problems.

Its purpose is not merely to collect notes, but to build statistical reasoning through systematic problem solving. Each notebook in this project exists to answer a specific statistical question.

Over time, this repository may serve as the foundation for technical articles or a book.

## Philosophy

Statistics is best understood when concepts emerge as tools for solving problems.

For this reason:

- Every notebook must solve a well-defined problem.
- Theory is introduced only when necessary.
- Concepts support reasoning.
- Structure is consistent across the entire project.

This repository is a laboratory of statistical thinking.

## Project Structure

The project follows a hierarchical organization:

Macrotheme → Theme → Problem

### Macrotheme

A broad area of statistics (e.g., Exploratory Analysis, Probability, Statistical Inference).

### Theme

A specific subtopic within a macrotheme.

### Problem (Notebook)

All notebooks follow a global structural standard defined in: NOTEBOOK_STRUCTURE.md

## Long-Term Vision

This repository is intended to evolve organically.

As problems accumulate, themes mature.
As themes mature, macrothemes consolidate.
Eventually, structure becomes theory.

Statistics is not presented as a collection of formulas, but as a coherent system built through problems.
