# Notebook Structure (Global Standard)

This document defines the mandatory structure for every notebook in this repository.

The objective is to ensure conceptual clarity, consistency, and a problem-driven approach throughout the entire project.

Every notebook must solve a specific statistical problem.

No exceptions.

## Required Structure

Each notebook must contain the following sections:

## 1. 🎯 Problem

A clear and precise statement of the statistical problem to be solved.

The problem must be concrete.  
Purely theoretical expositions are not allowed.

---

## 2. 📚 Concepts Involved

Definitions, theorems, or theoretical background necessary to understand the problem.

Concepts should be introduced only if they are required for solving the problem.

---

## 3. 🧠 Strategy

Explanation of the reasoning used to approach the problem.

This section clarifies *why* the chosen method works.

---

## 4. 🧪 Implementation

Code and computational steps used to obtain results.

Implementation must support reproducibility.

---

## 5. 📊 Interpretation

Statistical interpretation of the results.

Numbers without interpretation are incomplete.

---

## 6. 🔎 References

Bibliographical references and additional sources.

Concepts may originate from multiple sources.

---

# Guiding Rules

- One notebook = one problem.
- No purely theoretical notebooks.
- Code must support reasoning.
- Every result must be interpreted.
- Clarity is prioritized over complexity.

---

# Purpose

This structure is designed to:

- Encourage disciplined reasoning.
- Build knowledge cumulatively.
- Facilitate future transformation into articles or book chapters.
- Maintain long-term coherence across macrothemes.

Consistency is not cosmetic — it is methodological.
